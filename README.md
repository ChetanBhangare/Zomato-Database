# Zomato-Database
The Zomato project in SQL is a hypothetical project that involves creating a database for a food delivery company, similar to Zomato. The project would typically include designing a database schema, creating tables, defining relationships between tables, and writing SQL queries to perform various operations on the database.
Here is a brief description of what the project might entail:

Database schema design: The first step in creating a Zomato-like database would be to design a database schema that would capture all the relevant data points needed to operate a food delivery company. This might include tables for restaurants, customers, orders, reviews, menus, and more.

Table creation: Once the schema is designed, the next step would be to create tables in SQL that correspond to each of the entities defined in the schema. For example, there might be a "restaurants" table with columns for name, address, cuisine type, rating, and more.

Defining relationships: After the tables are created, relationships need to be defined between them to enable more complex queries. For example, there might be a foreign key relationship between the "orders" table and the "customers" table to track which orders belong to which customers.

Writing SQL queries: Once the database schema, tables, and relationships are defined, various SQL queries need to be written to interact with the database. For example, queries could be written to retrieve data on the most popular restaurants, the highest-rated dishes, or the most active customers.

Overall, the Zomato project in SQL would involve designing a robust database schema, creating tables, defining relationships, and writing SQL queries to perform various operations on the database.
